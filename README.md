# Weather App
* Made using the usual HTML, CSS, and JS combo with Bootstrap.
# How to use
* As this is made for development not production, you need a server such as Apache or Nginx, a quick all in one installer would be Xampp.
* An Alternative would be to use the "Live Server" extension in the Visual Studio Code text editor. 
# API
* Go to https://developer.accuweather.com.
* Sign up at AccuWeather.
* After logging in, sign up to the "My App " section, and click on "Add New App" , fill in the details.
* After filling the details, you'll receive an API key, copy it and paste it into the key variable in Forecast.js.
* go to the forecast.js file and replace that API code with yours (as my key is the trial version and thus has limited calls per day).
